<!-- ## 📚 About -->

<!-- This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Java** —  
starting from the absolute **basics** to **advanced** topics like **Trees**, **Graphs**, **Dynamic Programming**, and more.

The idea is to **keep it beginner-friendly**, but also **showcase** clean and abstract coding practices 🚀.  
Feel free to explore, learn, or even contribute if you'd like!
